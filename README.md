# SecureCall

A secure video calling application that uses cryptographic authentication to prevent impersonation and deepfake attacks.

## What It Does

SecureCall verifies caller identity using facial recognition combined with cryptographic signatures. When you make a call, the app:

1. Uses a biometric factor or passkey to verify your face
2. Proves your identity with a unique cryptographic signature
3. Allows the receiver to verify you are really you, even with the arise of AI

This prevents attackers from impersonating you, even with deepfake technology.
